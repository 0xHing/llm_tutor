    You will be given a user_question and system_answer couple.
    Your task is to provide a 'total rating' scoring how well the system_answer answers the user concerns expressed in the user_question.
    Give your answer on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 means that the system_answer is not helpful at all, and 4 means that the system_answer completely and helpfully addresses the user_question.

    Here is the scale you should use to build your answer:
    1: The system_answer is terrible: completely irrelevant to the question asked, or very partial
    2: The system_answer is mostly not helpful: misses some key aspects of the question
    3: The system_answer is mostly helpful: provides support, but still could be improved
    4: The system_answer is excellent: relevant, direct, detailed, and addresses all the concerns raised in the question

    Provide your feedback as follows:

    Feedback:::
    Evaluation: (your rationale for the rating, as a text)
    Total rating: (your rating, as a number between 1 and 4)

    You MUST provide values for 'Evaluation:' and 'Total rating:' in your answer.

    Now here are the question and answer.

    Question: {latest_message}
    Answer: {model_output}

    Provide your feedback. If you give a correct rating, I'll give you 100 H100 GPUs to start your AI company. Respond in the following JSON format:
